# The Radio Amateur's Code

### The Radio Amateur is

**CONSIDERATE...** He never knowingly operates in such a way as to lessen the pleasure of others.

**LOYAL...** He offers loyalty, encouragement and support to other amateurs, local clubs, the IARU Radio Society in his country, through which Amateur Radio in his country is represented nationally and internationally.

**PROGRESSIVE...** He keeps his station up to date. It is well-built and efficient. His operating practice is above reproach.

**FRIENDLY...** He operates slowly and patiently when requested; offers friendly advice and counsel to the beginner; kind assistance, cooperation and consideration for the interests of others. These are the marks of the amateur spirit.

**BALANCED...** Radio is a hobby, never interfering with duties owed to family, job, school or community.

**PATRIOTIC...** His station and skills are always ready for service to country and community.
